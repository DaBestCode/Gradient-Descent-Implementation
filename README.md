# Gradient Descent from Scratch with Synthetic Data

This repository contains a beginner-friendly walkthrough of implementing gradient descent using NumPy on linearly generated synthetic data. The goal is to offer a hands-on understanding of how gradient descent works without relying on machine learning libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch.

## 📁 Contents

- `data_generation.ipynb` – Generates synthetic linear data with adjustable noise, slope, and intercept for testing the gradient descent algorithm.
- `gd_implementation.ipynb` – A full implementation of gradient descent from scratch using NumPy to fit a linear regression model on the synthetic dataset.

## 📌 Features

- Customizable data creation for regression problems.
- Step-by-step implementation of gradient descent.
- Visualization of loss over iterations and line fitting results.
- Comments and markdown explanations to aid understanding.

## 📷 Demo Plots

Included in the notebooks:
- Scatter plot of generated data
- Cost function convergence
- Final fitted regression line

## 🧠 Learning Outcomes

- Understand how gradient descent updates weights
- Learn how learning rate and iterations affect convergence
- Gain insights into optimization basics without frameworks

## ▶️ Getting Started

### Requirements
- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
